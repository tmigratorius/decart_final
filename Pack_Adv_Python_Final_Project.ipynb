    "\n",
    "Vectors - went over what a vector is, how it is repersented in python and what type of information it holds. explained the difference between a column and a row vector. Practiced basic vector math with code examples. Explained the utility of numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Matricies - explained matricies as collections of vectors and their relationship to systems of linear equations. Went over basic matrix math with simple program examples. Practiced rotation in a 2 d plane and matrix x matrix math. Practiced transposing a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "installing and working with the myla package - all of the linear algebra functions/examples we had been working on are stored in the myla package. We installed, used, changed, and reinstalled the myla package to get familiar with how packaging works and how to test your packages \n",
    "\n",
    "#### day 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Spent more time in the myla package, tweaking examples and further understanding the math. Reviewed packaging structure and the different schemes and organization strategies used depending on the package type and needs. Used some pre-constructed code to practice pylint. Had pylint races to try to increase the score in a fixed time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Began writing unit tests for our packaget to make sure things worked as needed, and to make sure inputs were of the correct type. Began exploring the pytest package for writing tests, testing code and finding the errors.\n",
    "linear algebra by hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Looked at profiling code in order to optimize it, explored IDEs and how they can assist in the development process.\n",
    "#### day 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explained that the linear alegbra functions we had been working on are inefficient and the numpy package has functions already written to accomplish what we were doing much faster. Explored the numpy package and its methods\n",
    "\n",
    "gaussian elimination - went through a lengthy example on gaussian elimination. Wrote code step by step to accomplish the backward and forward solve, explained what the code was trying to do mathematically each step of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### day 4\n",
    "\n",
    "broke into teams to attempt to properly package our group's myla package and begin writing unit tests on our own. This involved a fair amount of familiarization with git, issues with windows incompatability, etc. Worked together to determine the proper structure of the package. Spend a lot of time trying to get all parites connected to the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Continued with testing, practicing debugging, and profiling. Explored IDEs and the ipbd package. Used ipbd and spyder IDE to test code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### day 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewed orthogonality, how to compute an orthogonal vector. Wrote functions, docstrings, and tests for orthogonality. Practiced by writing and testing code for gram-schmidt orthogonalization. These functions went into the teamwork section. Reviewed eigen vectors, tried sympy for computing eigen vectors and went over symbolic math in python.\n",
